Brief Overview: This a node application that uses an express server and an orm to retrieve data from the "burgers" table. The user is able to add their own burgers to the list of burgers to-be-eaten (have NOT been devoured). Next to each burger is a "Devour" button which the user can press to "Eat-Da-Burger!" The default state of each burger in the table is devoured = false, and then it switches to true once the user clicks "Devour."
